# **Psychological characteristics of students and their parents**


## Sample  

The study was conducted in two Moscow schools.  
After preliminary data cleaning, students who did not answer more than 5% of the total number of questions were eliminated. Also, students under 16 years of age were eliminated from the sample, since T. Leary's method for diagnosing interpersonal relationships was tested on subjects who were at least 16 years old.
As a result, the sample consisted of 47 people, including 27 girls and 20 boys. The average age of the subjects was 16.23 years.

## Statistical analysis  

To check the data for normal distribution, the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** criterion was used. As a result, it was found that the distribution did not correspond to the normal distribution for two features. Since not all criteria are subject to normal distribution, we chose a non-parametric method of data processing - **Spearman's rank correlation coefficient**.  
## Results and hypotheses
**General dominance and cooperation.**  
Students' Dominance correlates with Dominance, Authoritarianism, as well as Altruism and Positive interest, while an inverse correlation was found with Fathers Hostility. It is interesting to notice, that the Dominance in general is associated specifically with Fathers' characteristics, while on the Cooperation scale, connections were found specifically with mothers' characteristics, a positive correlation with Cooperation and a negative correlation with Mothers' Aggression.  

But what would happen to the data if the students were **divided into two groups** based on the attitude of both parents towards them? The following dashboard will help us answer the question.

And immediately we can find both something similar and something different between the students in general and our new groups.  We can see again that in the group with a positive attitude of both parents towards the child, Dominance of students correlates with all **the same characteristics of Fathers**, with the **exception of Hostility**. And in the group with a negative attitude, new characteristics of fathers appear - **Cooperation and Distrust** (while Distrust correlates negatively).  

It is easy to notice that there is **no sixth chart** on the dashboard. Surprisingly, when split into groups, statistically significant correlations with students Cooperation in the negative attitude group disappear. Cooperation of students with a positive attitude also changed, connections with Cooperation of **both parents**, as well as with Dependence of fathers and Obedience of mothers appeared.   

Of course, these results could have been obtained for a number of reasons and one can build theories as to why the picture is exactly like this. In addition to the possibility of various kinds of errors, accidents and features of a specific sample, one can also come to quite interesting conclusions. For example, the reason could be the active will of a person. People with a negative attitude of both parents do not strive to be like them and Dominance arises in them in **contrast** to the soft behavior of the father - **Cooperation, Positive interest**. While a person from the opposite group may have a desire to become like his father - more Dominant and Authoritarian. The absence of connections with Cooperation also fits into this theory; a person with negative attitude of parents is more likely to draw his abilities for Cooperation from communication with people **outside the family**, since he actively does not want to be like his parents. And a person from another group, on the contrary, will draw inspiration from the characteristics of both parents.
